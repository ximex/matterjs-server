## Missing Functionality - Detailed

### ~~1. `commission_on_network`~~ ✅ IMPLEMENTED

This command has been implemented. See `WebSocketControllerHandler.#handleCommissionOnNetwork()`.

Supports:
- `setup_pin_code` - Required passcode
- `filter_type` - 0=None, 1=ShortDiscriminator, 2=LongDiscriminator, 3=VendorId
- `filter` - Filter value based on type
- `ip_addr` - Direct IP address for commissioning

> **Note:** `set_acl_entry` and `set_node_binding` have also been implemented.

---

### ~~1. `get_node`~~ ✅ IMPLEMENTED

This command has been implemented. See `WebSocketControllerHandler.#handleGetNode()`.

Returns a single `MatterNode` by ID - same structure as `get_nodes`.

---

### ~~2. `interview_node`~~ ✅ IMPLEMENTED

This command has been implemented. See `WebSocketControllerHandler.#handleInterviewNode()`.

Since Matter.js nodes are kept up-to-date via attribute subscriptions, we don't need
to re-read all attributes. The implementation emits a `node_updated` event with the
current (already fresh) data, matching Python server behavior.

---

### 1. `ping_node` - Full Implementation (Priority: Low)

**Purpose:** Actually ping a node's IP addresses to verify network connectivity.

**Current State:** Stubbed - returns cached IPs with `true` status without actual ping.

**Python Implementation:**
```python
async def ping_node(
    self,
    node_id: int,
    attempts: int = 1
) -> dict[str, bool]  # {ip_address: reachable}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Diagnose connectivity issues
- Verify node is reachable before commands
- Network troubleshooting

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use ICMP ping or Matter operational ping
- Support multiple attempts for reliability
- Return per-IP-address results

---

### ~~5. `set_acl_entry`~~ ✅ IMPLEMENTED

This command has been implemented. See `ControllerCommandHandler.setAclEntry()`.

---

### ~~6. `set_node_binding`~~ ✅ IMPLEMENTED

This command has been implemented. See `ControllerCommandHandler.setNodeBinding()`.

---

### ~~5. `node_event` Event~~ ✅ IMPLEMENTED

This event has been implemented. See `WebSocketControllerHandler.onEventChanged()`.

The implementation forwards Matter events to WebSocket clients with the following structure:
```typescript
{
    node_id: number | bigint,
    endpoint_id: number,
    cluster_id: number,
    event_id: number,
    event_number: number | bigint,
    priority: number,        // 0=Debug, 1=Info, 2=Critical
    timestamp: number | bigint,
    timestamp_type: number,  // 0=System, 1=Epoch, 2=POSIX
    data: unknown | null
}
```

---

### 5. `server_shutdown` Event (Priority: Low)

**Purpose:** Notify clients that the server is shutting down gracefully.

**Use Cases:**
- Client can reconnect to backup server
- Client can notify user of disconnection reason
- Clean disconnection handling

**Implementation Notes:**
- Send before closing WebSocket connections
- Include shutdown reason if available

---

### 7. `server_info_updated` Event (Priority: Low)

**Purpose:** Notify clients when server configuration changes.

**Triggers:**
- WiFi credentials set/cleared
- Thread dataset set/cleared
- Bluetooth enabled/disabled

**Use Cases:**
- UI updates to reflect server capabilities
- Commissioning flow adjustments

---

### 8. `endpoint_added` / `endpoint_removed` Events (Priority: Medium)

**Purpose:** Notify clients when bridge devices add/remove child endpoints dynamically.

**Data Format:**
```python
(node_id: int, endpoint_id: int)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Bridge device adds new child device
- Bridge device removes child device
- Dynamic device discovery on bridges

**Implementation Notes:**
- Monitor Descriptor cluster's PartsList attribute
- Compare before/after to detect changes
- Important for Hue Bridge, IKEA Gateway, etc.

---

### 9. OTA Update Support (Priority: Low)

**`check_node_update`:**
- Query Matter CSA Distributed Compliance Ledger (DCL) for updates
- Compare device's current version with available versions
- Return update info if available

**`update_node`:**
- Download firmware from DCL or local source
- Host firmware via built-in OTA Provider
- Trigger OTA Requestor on device
- Monitor update progress

**Implementation Notes:**
- Requires DCL API integration
- OTA Provider already exists in Matter.js server (endpoint 1)
- Complex multi-step process

---

### 10. `import_test_node` (Priority: Low)

**Purpose:** Import mock/test nodes from a diagnostics dump for testing without physical devices.

**Python Implementation:**
```python
async def import_test_node(self, dump: str) -> None
```

**Use Cases:**
- Testing integrations without hardware
- Reproducing issues from user diagnostics
- Development and debugging

**Implementation Notes:**
- Parse JSON dump from `diagnostics` command
- Create mock node entries
- Node IDs >= 900000 reserved for test nodes

## Data Structure Differences

### ServerInfoMessage

| Field | Python | Matter.js | Notes |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| `fabric_id` | ✅ | ✅ | |
| `compressed_fabric_id` | ✅ | ✅ | |
| `schema_version` | ✅ | ✅ | Both use version 11 |
| `min_supported_schema_version` | ✅ | ✅ | |
| `sdk_version` | ✅ | ✅ | CHIP SDK version string |
| `wifi_credentials_set` | ✅ | ✅ | |
| `thread_credentials_set` | ✅ | ✅ | |
| `bluetooth_enabled` | ✅ | ✅ | |

### MatterNode

Both implementations use compatible structures with attribute paths in `endpoint/cluster/attribute` format.

---

## Implementation Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Required for Home Assistant parity)
All high-priority items have been implemented! ✅

### Medium Priority (Important features)
1. `endpoint_added`/`endpoint_removed` events - Bridge support

### Low Priority (Nice to have)
2. `ping_node` - Full implementation
3. `server_shutdown` event
4. `server_info_updated` event
5. OTA update support
6. `import_test_node` - Testing support

---

## Compatibility Notes

1. **Schema Version:** Both use schema version 11, ensuring protocol compatibility
2. **Attribute Format:** Both use `endpoint/cluster/attribute` path format
3. **Data Encoding:** Both use tag-based numeric encoding for structs (e.g., `{"0": value}`)
4. **BigInt Handling:** Both handle node IDs as potentially large integers

The Matter.js server is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the Python Matter Server when used with Home Assistant's Matter integration.
