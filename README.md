# Open Home Foundation Matter(.js) Server

![Matter Logo](docs/matter_logo.svg)

> [!WARNING]
> This is an Alpha version of a matter.js-based controller with a [Python Matter Server](https://github.com/matter-js/python-matter-server) compatible WebSocket interface.
> This version is not yet officially re-certified by the CSA, but will be during the current Alpha/Beta phase.
> 
> Please refer to the [Alpha/Beta testing instructions](ALPHABETATESTS.md) how to test this version.

The Open Home Foundation Matter Server serves as the foundation to provide Matter support to [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) but its universal approach makes it suitable to be used in other projects too.

This project implements a Matter Controller Server over WebSockets using JavaScript Matter SDK [matter.js](https://github.com/matter-js/matter.js)
as a base and provides a server implementation.

The Open Home Foundation Matter Server software component is a project of the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/).

The current version of the server supports Matter 1.4.2 and is a drop-in replacement for the Python Matter Server.
The Home Assistant integration is based on the Python bindings of the Python Matter Server v8.1.2, which uses a Matter-SDK version 1.4.2 (from 30.06.2025).

This repository consists of multiple packages that are provided in the `packages` directory:
* `matter-server`: The OHF Matter Server using the below packages to provide functionality on a webserver (published to npmjs as `matter-server`)
* `ws-controller`: The WebSocket-based Matter Controller implementation using matter.js (published to npmjs as `@matter-server/ws-controller`)
* `ws-client`: A WebSocket client library for connecting to the Matter Server (usable in browser and Node.js) (published to npmjs as `@matter-server/ws-client`)
* `custom-clusters`: A set of community-provided custom Matter clusters used by the Matter Server (published to npmjs as `@matter-server/custom-clusters`)
* `dashboard`: A dashboard to interact with the Matter Server and show node detailed data (published to npmjs as `@matter-server/dashboard`)

## Alpha/Beta testing instructions

As mentioned above the enw Matter server is currently in a Testing phase.

Please see the [Alpha/Beta testing instructions](ALPHABETATESTS.md) for more information.

## Support

During the Alpha/Beta phase of the matter.js-based Matter server, we enabled issue creation for this version via GitHub issues. If you use the Python Matter server and your issue is not related to a Migration-issue from/to matter.js-Server, please use the options listed below.

For users of Home Assistant, seek support in the official Home Assistant support channels.

## Installation / Running the Matter Server

- Endusers of Home Assistant, refer to the [Home Assistant documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/matter/) how to run Matter in Home Assistant using the official Matter Server add-on, which is based on this project. Choose the "Beta" version if you want to test the matter.js based server (soon)

- For running the server and/or client in your development environment, see the [Development documentation](DEVELOPMENT.md).

- For running the Matter Server as a standalone docker container, see our instructions [here](docs/docker.md).

### Manual installation (from npm)
* Ensure to have Node.js 20.x, 22.x, or 24.x installed (22.x recommended)
* `npm install matter-server`
* `npx matter-server` or alternatively `cd node_modules/matter-server && npm run server`

If you want to provide more parameters when using "npm run" (not needed when using npx!) use an extra "--" to separate parameters, see below.

### Manual installation (for local development)
* clone the repository
* `npm i` in the root directory to install npm dependencies and do initial build
* (`npm run build`) if ever needed after changing code
* `npm run server` to start it

The server is started on port localhost:5580 and listens fpr WS on "/ws"

Configure the HA instance against this server and have fun :-)

### Tips
* to control the storage directory use `--storage-path .ha1` as parameter to use local dir `.ha1` for storage
* to limit network interfaces (especially good idea on Macs sometimes) use `--primary-interface en0`

So as example to do both use `npm run server -- --storage-path .ha1 --primary-interface en0` (note the extra "--" to pass parameters to the script).

It was in general tested with a simply slight bulb on network.

Ble and Wifi should work when server gets startes with `--ble` flag, but Wifi only will work. For Thread Mater.js currently requires a network Name which is not provided.

## Differences from Python Matter Server

This implementation aims to be API-compatible with the [Python Matter Server](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/python-matter-server), but there are some intentional differences:

| Feature                 | Python Matter Server                          | Matter.js Server                                                                                           |

| Fabric Label            | Accepts null/empty to clear                   | Resets to "Home" when null/empty                                                                           |
| Storage Format          | Single `chip.json` and `{fabricId}.json` file | matter.js native storage (migration supported)                                                             |
| Attribute Subscriptions | Tracks per-node in `attribute_subscriptions`  | Always empty (handled internally)                                                                          |
| Eve Energy Polling      | Polls custom eve cluster every 30s            | Not implemented (use updated firmware)                                                                     |
